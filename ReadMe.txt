Hello there
For phase 1  submission plz note:

1- Excternal files are saved and loaded from Save Folder and are written without the .txt
2- course catalog is created temporarily with nonsense data to run the program.
3- Rules imported and the file is only an example not the main one.
4- Course information can be shown in status bar by clicking on it .
5- There is a delay in in updating interface, Currently the team is working on a fix
6- while pressing on the course to show course information you must click twice to do another action.
7- Add Note only takes 17 chrachters (the more will not be shown) ----> will be fixed later.
8- Editing a course does not replace it in the same postion ----> will be fixed later.
9- Minimizing the Window will make it blank and stops without any reason.
